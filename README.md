The Cry Counter project aimed to contribute to the enhancement of student mental health by developing an Android 
application focused on tracking and graphing stressful situations leading to emotional outbursts. 
The core functionalities and features of the app included leveraging the MPAndroidChart Graphing API to create informative visuals depicting the 
frequency of stressors and their associated locations and Google Firebase to manage all user data.
